TCGPlayer doesn't have any way to access the internal IDs used as a seller.

Only way to access them is paid method.

Could also probably manually create a database by exporting a csv of every card from TCGplayer, and using a script to make one from the CSV.

Might be difficult, it mostly would be easy or hard on how long it would take to enter the cards into the inventory.
